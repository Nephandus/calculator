This is a basic, slightly graphical calculator for TheOdinProject's final Foundations project. Certain parts of the implementation were defined in the instructions for practice reasons; otherwise, it'd be coded differently. It's not getting prettier or a backspace function or keyboard support, unless I get really bored someday since I finally get to start the Ruby on Rails track after pushing this.
